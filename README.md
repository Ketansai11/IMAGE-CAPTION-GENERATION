1.Introduction
Image caption generation involves creating a textual description of an image. This project uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating captions.

2.Requirements
  ->Python 3.x
  ->Google Colab (optional for running the notebook in the cloud)
  ->TensorFlow
  ->NumPy
  ->tqdm
You can install the required libraries using standard package installation commands.

3.Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes images and their corresponding captions. The notebook assumes the dataset is stored in Google Drive for easy access.

4.Feature Extraction
The notebook uses the VGG16 model to extract features from images. The VGG16 model is modified to output features from the second-to-last layer.

5.Model Training
The extracted features are used to train an LSTM model to generate captions. The training process involves:
  Tokenizing the captions.
  Padding sequences.
  Creating the LSTM model.
  Training the model with the image features and tokenized captions.
6.Caption Generation
After training, the model can generate captions for new images. The process involves passing the image through the VGG16 model to get features and then using the LSTM model to generate a caption.

7.Usage
  ->Mount Google Drive: Ensure your dataset and working directories are properly set up in Google Drive.
  ->Set Directories: Define the base and working directories for your dataset and project files.
  ->Extract Image Features: Utilize the VGG16 model to extract features from your images.
  ->Train the Model: Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, and train it.
  ->Generate Captions: Use the trained model to generate captions for new images.
8.Results
The notebook provides an example of generating captions for a set of test images. The results are displayed with the images and their generated captions. This demonstrates the model's ability to understand and describe visual content.
